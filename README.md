# Airbus Ship Detection Challenge
This reposetory is a homework for this course: [http://smartlab.tmit.bme.hu/oktatas-deep-learning](http://smartlab.tmit.bme.hu/oktatas-deep-learning).
For detaild description about the project and the team members, pleas check our [wiki](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-GAZ/Airbus-Ship-Detection-Challenge/wiki).
A quick overview about oru current state.
* [Vizualization.ipynb](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-GAZ/Airbus-Ship-Detection-Challenge/blob/master/Vizualization.ipynb) show a sigle image and it's annotation from the dataset.
* [VisualizeShipOccurances.ipynb](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-GAZ/Airbus-Ship-Detection-Challenge/blob/master/VisualizeShipOccurances.ipynb) show heatmaps about where the ships are located.
* [DataExploration.ipynb](https://github.com/Deep-Learning-GAZ/Airbus-Ship-Detection-Challenge/blob/master/DataExploration.ipynb) calculates various statistiscs about the dataset, like ship counts area etc.
